This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object before it has been fully rendered or populated with data from an asynchronous operation.  This often happens when fetching data from an API, where the state update might lag behind the component's render cycle.  Consider this example:

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  state = {
    userData: null,
  };

  componentDidMount() {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/user')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ userData: data }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{this.state.userData.name}</Text> {/* Potential error here */}
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```

If the `fetch` call hasn't completed, `this.state.userData` will be `null`, causing a runtime error when trying to access `userData.name`.
